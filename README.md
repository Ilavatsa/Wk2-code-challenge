Description
This project consists of three JavaScript functions: swapCase, generateArray, and filterPrimes.

SwapCase
swapCase is a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the case of each letter is swapped. For example, uppercase letters become lowercase and vice versa.

GenerateArray
generateArray is a function that generates an array of numbers within a specified range. It takes two parameters: start and end, and returns an array containing all integers from start to end, inclusive.

FilterPrimes
filterPrimes is a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the input array. It uses the isPrime function internally to determine if a number is prime.
